# Rainfall Forecasting with Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores rainfall forecasting using both **classical time-series models** and **modern machine learning/deep learning approaches**.  
The goal is to evaluate how statistical baselines (e.g., persistence, ARIMA) compare against ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., LSTM) on real-world rainfall data.

This project is part of my graduate school portfolio, demonstrating applied data science skills, end-to-end pipelines, and model interpretability.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Build an end-to-end **rainfall prediction pipeline**.  
- Compare **baseline, ML, and DL** models on short-term forecasting.  
- Explore **interpretability** (feature importance, SHAP) and **uncertainty** in predictions.  
- Deploy an **interactive research playground app** where users can explore predictions.
